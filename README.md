# Performance_Optimization
Apply the skills learned for optimization of graphics, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to take a poorly optimized site and reduce the total load size to under 1.3mb and total requests to less than 27. Students will need to analyze the assets they've been provided to see where optimizations can and need to be made, make those optimizations, and measure their success. Multiple analyzation, optimization, and measuring cycles may be required.

## Building process (in case you are missing the dist folder)
1. Open up a terminal window and change your working directory to root of this repo.
2. Run `npm install` command in your terminal window.
3. Change your working directory to `/src` of this repo.
4. Run `gulp` command.
5. A new `dist` folder will appear in the root of this repo with optimized build up.
6. At this point dist is already included.

## To do
1. Include various image sources for different sizing and screen sizes.
2. Gzip is included but commented out for testing purposes.
